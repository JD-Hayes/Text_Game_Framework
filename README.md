Introduction to the basics of using Crow

Using the introduction to Crow we did in class and the fancy website portion, you must complete the following tutorial found: 
https://crowcpp.org/master/getting_started/a_simple_webpage/
This needs to use CMake, and have the proper directories to work.

In addition, you must post a Panopto video of your program under the same assignment and do the following:
Explain the setup of the directories
explain the code in main.cpp. each line should have comments and needs to be explained
explain the code in CMakeLists.txt. ea h line should have comments and needs to be explained.
explain the code in templates. each line should have comments and needs to be explained.

execute the program and show that the program runs on your local server. Run twice, showing this works with two different "names" at the end of the URL.

submit the directories to github classroom and the panopto video on canvas.
